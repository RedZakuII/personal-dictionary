# Steno dictionaries
This is a combination of all of the dictionaries I use in a singular git repo for easy sharing across computers and environments. It includes several git submodules so I can easily update and include dictionaries I use:
 * Emily's Modifiers in `emily-modifiers`
 * Emily's Symbols in `emily-symbols`
 * Aerick's Lapwing dictionaries in `steno-dictionaries`
 * Jeff's Phrasing dictionary in `jeff-phrasing`

All my stuff is at the base of the repo and augments these submodules.
